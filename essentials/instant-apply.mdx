## Why Fast Apply?

Fast Apply addresses key challenges in code generation:

1. **Eliminates Output Degradation**: Traditional large language models tend to abbreviate or omit functionality on long-context tasks. Common approaches like Search/Replace or Diff formats become token-inefficient with 300B+ models, leading to slower and less reliable results.

2. **Superior Speed**: With speeds of 900-1200 tokens/second, Fast Apply provides significant performance benefits for realtime generation, especially crucial for multi-LLM chains requiring parallel code generation.

3. **Contextual Understanding**: Fast Apply maintains high accuracy by deeply understanding code context and dependencies, enabling it to generate code that seamlessly integrates with existing codebases while respecting established patterns and conventions.

## Where Fast Apply Fits in AI Agent Systems

Fast Apply is optimally positioned for snippet-based code generation within larger AI agent workflows:

1. **Multi-File Code Generation**: When agents need to modify multiple files or make complex changes across a codebase, traditional approaches face significant challenges:

   - Large models like Claude take 60-120 seconds to output complete files
   - Context windows limit the amount of code that can be considered

2. **Snippet-First Architecture**: Instead of asking SOTA models to generate entire files, a more efficient approach emerges:

   - Use primary model (e.g., Claude) to generate focused code snippets
   - Snippets are naturally in-distribution for these models

3. **Optimized Division of Labor**:
   - Primary LLM: Understands high-level intent and generates targeted snippets
   - Fast Apply: Rapidly and accurately merges snippets into existing code
   - Result: 5-10x faster execution with higher reliability

This architecture significantly reduces latency while maintaining high accuracy, making it ideal for real-time agent systems that need to generate and modify code across multiple files.

## How It Works: Speculative Decoding

Fast Apply utilizes speculative decoding to achieve its high performance. This technique allows the model to:

- Generate multiple tokens simultaneously by predicting likely sequences ahead of time
- Validate and correct predictions in parallel using a smaller, faster model
- Maintain high accuracy while significantly reducing latency through efficient verification

The process works in two key steps:

1. **Draft Generation**: A small, fast model generates initial token predictions for multiple positions ahead
2. **Verification**: The main model validates these predictions, accepting correct ones and adjusting where needed

This approach is particularly effective for code generation because programming languages have predictable patterns and structures that make speculative predictions more accurate.

## Our Models

We currently offer two specialized models:

| Model  | Speed      | Use Case                                   |
| ------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Fast   | 900 tok/s  | Balance of speed and processing complexity |
| Faster | 1200 tok/s | Maximum speed for realtime applications    |

## Comparison with Other Providers

| Provider   | Speed (tok/s) | Cost      | Key Limitations                    |
| ---------- | ------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Fast Apply | 900-1200      | Base      | Full functionality maintained      |
| Cerebras   | 2000-2200     | 3x Base   | 8k token limit, output degradation |
| GPT-4 Mini | ~200          | 1.5x Base | Lower accuracy, limited context    |

### Cerebras

While Cerebras offers higher raw speed, it costs 3x more and has an 8k token output limit. It also tends to skip or abbreviate functionality on complex tasks, making it unreliable for production use.

### GPT-4o Mini

GPT-4o Mini is significantly slower at 200 tokens/second and has lower accuracy on code tasks. Its limited context window makes it impractical for real-world applications.

## Prompt Engineering

Fast Apply requires specific prompt formatting to achieve optimal code generation. Here's the recommended structure:

### System Prompt

````
system_prompt = """
Your job is to suggest modifications to a provided codebase to satisfy a user request.
Narrow your focus on the USER REQUEST and NOT other unrelated aspects of the code.
Changes should be formatted in a semantic edit snippet optimized to minimize regurgitation of existing code.
Here are the rules, follow them closely:

- Abbreviate sections of the code in your response that will remain the same by replacing those sections with a comment like  "// ... rest of code ...", "// ... keep existing code ...", "// ... code remains the same".
- Be very precise with the location of these comments within your edit snippet. A less intelligent model will use the context clues you provide to accurately merge your edit snippet.
- If applicable, it can help to include some concise information about the specific code segments you wish to retain "// ... keep calculateTotalFunction ... ".
- If you plan on deleting a section, you must provide the context to delete it. Some options:
1. If the initial code is ```code, Block 1, Block 2, Block 3, code```, and you want to remove Block 2, you would output ```// ... keep existing code ..., Block 1,  Block 2, // ... rest of code ...```.
2. If the initial code is ```code, Block, code```, and you want to remove Block, you can also specify ```// ... keep existing code ..., // remove Block, // ... rest of code ...```.
- You must use the comment format applicable to the specific code provided to express these truncations.
- Preserve the indentation and code structure of exactly how you believe the final code will look (do not output lines that will not be in the final code after they are merged).

Be as length efficient as possible without omitting key context."""

user_prompt = """EXISTING CODE:
    {initial_code}

    MODIFICATION REQUEST:
    {user_instructions}"""
````
