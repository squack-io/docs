title: "Code Reranker"
description: "A specialized code-aware reranking system that eliminates the need for embedding-based retrieval, enabling accurate code edits on large codebases beyond LLM context limits."

## Why Use Code Reranker?

Code Reranker revolutionizes how we handle large codebases with LLMs:

- **No Embeddings Required:** Direct semantic understanding of code relationships
- **Context Optimization:** Intelligently selects the most relevant code within token limits
- **Code-Specific Accuracy:** Outperforms generalist rerankers by understanding code structure, dependencies, and programming patterns

Unlike general-purpose rerankers, Code Reranker is specifically trained on code relationships and programming patterns, making it significantly more accurate for code-related tasks.

## Key Features

**Code-Aware Ranking:** Understands code structure and dependencies for better relevance.

**Token Management:** Automatically fits within specified token limits while maximizing relevance.

**Production Ready:** Tested and optimized for large-scale production codebases.

**Language Agnostic:** Works with any programming language or framework.

## API Reference

### **Endpoint**

POST ranker.endpoint.relace.run/v1/code/rank

### Request Body

query - The modification or search request

codebase - Array of file objects containing filename and code

token_limit - Maximum tokens to return

### Example Request

<div style={{ whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap', overflowX: 'auto' }}>
```json
curl -X POST "https://ranker.endpoint.relace.run/v1/code/rank" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [YOUR_API_KEY]" \
  -d '{
    "query": "Optimize the search function for better performance",
    "codebase": [
      {
        "filename": "src/search.ts",
        "code": "function findItem(array: Item[], targetId: string): Item | undefined {\n  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    const item = array[i];\n    if (item.id === targetId) {\n      return item;\n    }\n  }\n  return undefined;\n}"
      },
      {
        "filename": "src/types.ts",
        "code": "interface Item {\n  id: string;\n  value: string;\n  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;\n}"
      }
    ],
    "token_limit": 128000
  }'
```
</div>

### Response

<div style={{ whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap', overflowX: 'auto' }}>
```json
[
  "src/search.ts",
  "src/types.ts"
]
```
</div>

## Troubleshooting

### Best Practices

- Be specific in your queries about what code you're looking for
- Consider including relevant technical terms from your codebase
- Set appropriate token limits based on your LLM's capabilities

### Common Issues

- Token limit too low for meaningful context - increase the limit
- Too many irrelevant results - make your query more specific
- Missing critical files - check if all necessary files are included in the codebase array
