## Welcome to the Relace API

The Relace API provides access to powerful code generation models that help developers work more efficiently. Our API offers two main endpoints:

1. **Instant Apply**: Merge code snippets from an LLM into your existing codebase
2. **Code Reranker**: Assess the relevance of files in your codebase to a user's query

## API Endpoints

The API is served from two different endpoints:

- **Instant Apply**: `https://instantapply.endpoint.relace.run`
- **Code Reranker**: `https://ranker.endpoint.relace.run`

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens. Include your API key in the Authorization header of your requests:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Rate Limits

The API has a rate limit of 3 requests per minute. When you exceed this limit, you'll receive a 429 response with the following headers:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Rate limit ceiling for your API key
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Number of requests left for the time window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time at which the rate limit resets

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure:

- `200`: Success
- `400`: Bad request
- `401`: Unauthorized
- `404`: API key not found
- `429`: Rate limit exceeded
- `500`: Internal server error

All error responses include a JSON body with details about the error.

## Getting Started

To start using the Relace API:

1. Obtain your API key from the [Relace Dashboard](https://app.relace.ai)
2. Choose the appropriate endpoint based on your needs
3. Include your API key in the Authorization header
4. Make requests to the API endpoints

For detailed information about each endpoint and their request/response formats, please refer to the API reference documentation.
