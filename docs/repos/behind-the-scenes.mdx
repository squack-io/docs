## Code-Specific Embeddings

Relace uses a specialized embeddings model designed specifically for code, not generic text. This model:

- Understands programming language syntax and semantics
- Recognizes relationships between functions, classes, and modules
- Maps natural language queries to relevant code patterns
- Works across all programming languages in your stack

## Automatic Indexing

When you upload a repository, Relace automatically:

- **Chunks your code** at logical boundaries (functions, classes, modules)
- **Generates embeddings** using our code-specific model
- **Keeps everything up-to-date** with incremental indexing on each code change
- **Requires zero configuration** - no chunking strategies or parameters to tune

## Two-Stage Retrieval

The Ask and Retrieve endpoints use a two-stage system:

1. **Semantic matching** - Vector similarity search finds potentially relevant code
2. **Intelligent reranking** - Our Code Reranker refines results for accuracy

This delivers sub-second response times while maintaining high relevance.

## Fast Git Performance

Relace maintains the git experience you're used to:

- Repository operations remain as fast as traditional git
- Semantic indexing happens in the background without slowing you down
- Multi-tenant architecture scales to thousands of repositories

## What This Means for You

You get semantic code understanding without the typical complexity:

- No embedding model selection or vector database setup
- No chunking configuration or index maintenance
- No performance tuning or scaling concerns
- Instant semantic search from upload to searchable in minutes

The infrastructure handles all the complexity so you can focus on building with semantic code understanding.
