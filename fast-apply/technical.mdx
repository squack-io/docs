## How It Works: Speculative Decoding

Fast Apply utilizes speculative decoding to achieve its high performance. This technique allows the model to:

- Generate multiple tokens simultaneously by predicting likely sequences ahead of time
- Validate and correct predictions in parallel using a smaller, faster model
- Maintain high accuracy while significantly reducing latency through efficient verification

The process works in two key steps:

1. **Draft Generation**: A small, fast model generates initial token predictions for multiple positions ahead
2. **Verification**: The main model validates these predictions, accepting correct ones and adjusting where needed

This approach is particularly effective for code generation because programming languages have predictable patterns and structures that make speculative predictions more accurate.
