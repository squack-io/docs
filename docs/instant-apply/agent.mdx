title: 'Agent Tool Definition'
---

Agents are continuously running LLMs that process user requests by calling a sequence of tools. Unlike workflows, they are fully autonomous and can be more flexible at coding.

## Why use Agents?

Agents dynamically expand their context by calling tools that explore the codebase, run scripts, and make iterative changes. The are slower and more expensive to run, but can do much more if architected well.

With the right choice of tools, you can optimize the steps the agent takes and cut down on latency/cost.

## Relace Edit Tool

Here's a tool definition we've seen work well as a replacement to Claude 4 Sonnet's string replace editor.

                    Here are the rules for formatting the edit snippet, follow them closely:

                    - Abbreviate sections of the code in your response that will remain the same by replacing those sections with a comment like  "// ... rest of code ...", "// ... keep existing code ...", "// ... code remains the same".
                    - Be very precise with the location of these comments within your edit snippet. A less intelligent model will use the context clues you provide to accurately merge your edit snippet.
                    - If applicable, it can help to include some concise information about the specific code segments you wish to retain "// ... keep calculateTotalFunction ... ".
                    - If you plan on deleting a section, you must provide the context to delete it. Some options:
                        1. If the initial code is ```code \n Block 1 \n Block 2 \n Block 3 \n code```, and you want to remove Block 2, you would output ```// ... keep existing code ... \n Block 1 \n  Block 3 \n // ... rest of code ...```.
                        2. If the initial code is ```code \n Block \n code```, and you want to remove Block, you can also specify ```// ... keep existing code ... \n // remove Block \n // ... rest of code ...```.
                    - You must use the comment format applicable to the specific code provided to express these truncations.
                    - Preserve the indentation and code structure of exactly how you believe the final code will look (do not output lines that will not be in the final code after they are merged).
                    - Be as length efficient as possible without omitting key context."""
