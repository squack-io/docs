## Overview

Relace Repos offers two powerful endpoints for semantic understanding of your codebase:

- **Ask**: Get natural language answers to questions about your code with built-in citations
- **Retrieve**: Get ranked lists of relevant files and code sections for a given query

Both endpoints leverage Relace's built-in two-stage retrieval system that automatically indexes your code and provides intelligent semantic search without any configuration.

## When to Use Each Endpoint

### Use Ask When:

- You need explanatory answers about how code works
- You want to understand complex workflows or architecture
- You need documentation-style responses with citations
- You're building conversational interfaces for code exploration
- You want quick summaries of functionality

### Use Retrieve When:

- You need specific files to work with for code generation
- You're building RAG systems that need ranked context
- You want to control the level of detail returned
- You need to filter results by relevance scores
- You're implementing semantic search features

## 1. Ask Questions About Your Code

The Ask endpoint returns natural language explanations perfect for understanding how your codebase works.

```python
import requests

repo_id = "your-repo-id"
url = f"https://api.relace.ai/v1/repo/{repo_id}/ask"
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Ask about authentication flow
data = {
    "query": "How does the user authentication system work in this codebase?"
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
answer = response.json()["answer"]
print(answer)
```

### Example Ask Queries:

- "How does error handling work across the application?"
- "What's the data flow for user registration?"
- "How are API keys validated and stored?"
- "What security measures are implemented?"
- "How does the caching system work?"

## 2. Retrieve Relevant Files and Code

The Retrieve endpoint returns ranked files with relevance scores, giving you precise control over what code to examine or use for generation.

```python
import requests

repo_id = "your-repo-id"
url = f"https://api.relace.ai/v1/repo/{repo_id}/retrieve"
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Find authentication-related files
data = {
    "query": "user authentication and login functionality",
    "score_threshold": 0.3,        # Only return files with 30%+ relevance
    "token_limit": 30000,          # Limit total tokens returned
    "include_content": True        # Include file content in response
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
results = response.json()["results"]

# Process results
for file in results:
    print(f"File: {file['filename']} (Score: {file['score']:.3f})")
    if file['score'] > 0.7:  # High relevance files
        print(f"Content preview: {file['content'][:200]}...")
```

### Example Retrieve Queries:

- "database connection and ORM setup"
- "API endpoint handlers for user management"
- "frontend components for data visualization"
- "test files for payment processing"
- "configuration and environment setup"

## 3. Best Practices

### Query Optimization

- **Be specific**: "JWT token validation middleware" vs "authentication"
- **Use domain language**: Include technical terms relevant to your stack
- **Ask follow-ups**: Use Ask to understand, then Retrieve for implementation

### Performance Tips

- Set appropriate `score_threshold` values (0.3-0.4 for balanced results)
- Use `include_content: false` for quick file discovery
- Adjust `token_limit` based on your downstream model's context window

### Integration Patterns

- **Documentation Generation**: Use Ask to create explanations of complex features
- **Code Generation**: Use Retrieve to gather relevant context for LLM code generation
- **Code Review**: Use Ask to understand unfamiliar code sections
- **Debugging**: Use Retrieve to find all files related to a specific error or feature

## Next Steps

Now that you understand semantic retrieval, you can:

- Integrate these endpoints into your AI coding workflows
- Build intelligent code exploration tools
- Create context-aware documentation systems
- Enhance your code generation pipelines
