## Introduction

Relace Repos is a fully managed version control system specifically designed for AI applications, offering:

- Lightweight read/write operations enabling easy integration with your backend.
- Semantic search that maintains low latency on large codebases.
- Multi-tenancy that scales to millions of repositories across thousands of users.
- Permissive rate limits that allow interactions across many repos simultaneously.

## Source Management for AI

Building a scalable AI code editing application usually requires:
- Durable storage of source code
- Versioning, so that unsuccessful or undesired changes can be easily reverted
- Low-latency reads/writes on the working version of the code
- Support for automated interactions with thousands of isolated repos
- Integration with GitHub, to allow human developers to easily collaborate on the same code base

Relace Repos offers a centralized platform that satisfies all of these requirements, seamlessly integrated with our state-of-the-art embedding and retrieval models.

## Existing Alternatives

Industry standard version control services like GitHub are designed primarily for human developers, which leads to some pain points for AI applications.

#### Service limits

Humans have low frequency manual interactions through websites and the git CLI. This results in relatively low limits that are insufficient for large scale automated AI applications:
- A single account/organization may not exceed [100,000 repos](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/repository-limits#organization-and-account-limits)
- REST API requests may not exceed [5,000 per hour](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28#primary-rate-limit-for-authenticated-users) (15,000 for a GitHub app owned by an enterprise organization)

Most text-to-app systems treat each user application as a single repo, which leads to the repo limit being reached very quickly. Systems with many concurrent users will also hit the rate limit relatively quickly. Assuming that a single AI edit requires at least 2 API calls (pulling and pushing), your capacity would be ~2 requests per second.

#### Integration complexity

Human developer workflows are less constrained and more complex than a typical AI application. This leads to a system that requires many distinct steps to make a simple change to the code base:
1. Clone/checkout the repository locally
2. Edit the files
3. Stage and commit the changes
4. Push to the remote

Since commits are made locally, you must setup a git library or the git CLI on your host. Given that most AI workflows are run in a serverless or sandboxed environment, this also means that full source retrieval must happen every time you spin up the environment. This contributes to high cold-start latency, and often necessitates some sort of file caching strategy.

A relatively simple workflow where an agent reads a code base and edits some files can quickly become a highly complex infrastructure problem.

## Built-in Two-Stage Retrieval

Providing the right code context to your LLM is essential to produce the best results without sacrificing cost or latency. A reranker model offers the highest quality retrieval, but is computationally expensive to run (retrieval cost scales with the size of the code base). Pre-computing vector embeddings for code and using a vector similarity search for retrieval offers much faster/cheaper retrieval, but with lower accuracy. The best approach tends to be a hybrid system, where a vector search is used to provide a reduced set of candidate files for a reranker.

Building this kind of system offers several challenges:
- Embedding and reranker models have a hard limit on the size of input files, which means large files need to be chunked
- Embeddings need to be stored in a vector database, and kept in sync with your source code
- Computing embeddings is slow; this means it must be done asynchronously, exposing potential race conditions

Relace Repos handles all of this complexity for you with our two-stage retrieval system:

**Stage 1: Indexing**

- Large files are chunked into meaningful segments and passed to our optimized [Embeddings](/docs/embeddings/quickstart) model
- Embeddings are updated asynchronously as your codebase evolves. Metadata is updated atomically with codebase edits to provide strongly consistent read-after-write retrieval.
- A vector similarity search over the stored embeddings is used to produce a set of candidate files for the reranker. Recently edited files that do not yet have stored embeddings are always included in the reranker input.

**Stage 2: Reranking**

- Candidate files from the first stage are passed to our [Code Reranker](/docs/code-reranker/overview) model
- Files are ranked by the model based on relevance to the input query
- Irrelevant code snippets are filtered out entirely
