When using frontier models like Claude 4 Sonnet to edit your codebase, you're paying premium rates for both valuable changes and unchanged sections alike.

Instant apply is about the separation of concerns -- use heavyweight frontier models for only the new sections of code, and use a lightweight apply model to merge the new into the old.

Our Instant Apply model precisely performs merges while running at **4300 tok/s** on average.

## Code Snippets

To save on cost and latency with Instant Apply, you must prompt the frontier model to create abbreviated snippets. Say we have the following code:

```
function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello world!");
}
```

If we want to add a function below it, the frontier model should only write the new function along with contextual information for where to put it.

```
// ... keep existing code

function goodbyeWorld() {
  console.log("Goodbye world!");
}
```

We use this structure because it's a natural format _all_ LLMs are naturally good at producing.

Structured diff formats like uDiff or search and replace (S&R) can be applied deterministically, but formatting error rates are high. Even the best models fail 10-15% of the time, and it's much worse for the more economical models like GPT 4o-mini and Haiku.

## Error Rate Comparison

Instant Apply is trained on a wide range of abbreviated edit snippets to make it SoTA for merging code.

For the above plot, we manually measured errors for different models on a set of 100 examples across 5 different programming languages. The rate was calculating by counting instances of the following:

- **Syntax Errors:** Merged code is not syntactically valid. _e.g._ Missing imports, unclosed brackets, etc.
- **Hallucinations:** Model included code that was not explicitly defined in the edit snippet.
- **Truncations:** Merged code didn't appropriately fill in a `// ... rest of code ...` block.

Even compared to a very powerful model like Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Relace had over 2x fewer errors.

## Speed Benchmarks

Our model is deployed with speculative decoding on an optimized inference engine that achieves 4300 tok/s on average.

This is more than an order of magnitude faster than any Anthropic or OpenAI model, and twice as fast as models run on specialized silicon (_e.g._ Cerebras).

In practice, due to the nature of [speculative decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17192) you may observe variance on speed depending on the complexity of the edit snippet. Here's a distribution of latency across n=500 requests:

## Comparison to Full File Rewrites

If you are currently doing full file rewrites, Instant Apply will save you on average:

- **~3-4x on end-to-end latency**
- **~3x on cost of output tokens from frontier models**
