## Why Use Code Reranker?

Code Reranker revolutionizes how we handle large codebases with LLMs:

- **No Embeddings Required:** Direct semantic understanding of code relationships
- **Context Optimization:** Intelligently selects the most relevant code within token limits
- **Code-Specific Accuracy:** Outperforms generalist rerankers by understanding code structure, dependencies, and programming patterns

Unlike general-purpose rerankers, Code Reranker is specifically trained on code relationships and programming patterns, making it significantly more accurate for code-related tasks.
